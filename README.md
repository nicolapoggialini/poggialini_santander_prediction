# Santander Customer Transaction Prediction
This project is focused on solving the following Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/santander-customer-transaction-prediction/overview. <br>
All the results have been produced using the Python notebook 'santander_notebook.ipynb': the notebook contains a cell to directly load the data in the current directory. <br>
The repository is then structured with the following folders:

- models: all the saved models that can be loaded to reproduce the predictions;
- presentation: the slides that sum up the work done and the results obtained;
- results: contains the file with the validation results;
- report: contains the report of the project, which corresponds to the PDF version of the notebook.
